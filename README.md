## What is a habit tracker
***
Habit trackers help you to monitor your progress on the positive habits you want to form. They encourage you to keep going and provide clear insight into how well youâ€™re really doing.
## Why you need this 
***
If you want to stick with a habit for good, one simple and effective thing you can do is keep a habit tracker. Elite performers will often measure, quantify, and track their progress in various ways. Each little measurement provides feedback. It offers a signal of whether they are making progress or need to change course.

## Getting started
***Firstly you have to download the python 3.10+ version on your operating system. You can download this from python [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

# Installation

``````commandline
pip install questionary
``````
Next thing you need is to install pytest. Which we use to test our project

pip install -u pytest
````
We also used a library called [time-machine](https://pypi.org/project/time-machine/) in testing for mocking the time
````commandline
pip install time-machine
````
or 
````commandline
python -m pip install time-machine
````
## How do we rum the program
