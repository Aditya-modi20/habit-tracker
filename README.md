## What is a habit tracker
***
Habit trackers help you to monitor your progress on the positive habits you want to form. They encourage you to keep going and provide clear insight into how well youâ€™re really doing.
## Why you need this 
***
If you want to stick with a habit for good, one simple and effective thing you can do is keep a habit tracker. Elite performers will often measure, quantify, and track their progress in various ways. Each little measurement provides feedback. It offers a signal of whether they are making progress or need to change course.

## Getting started
